This project, funded by a grant from the [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](www.mellon.org), is a joint partnership between Stanfordâ€™s Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis]( http://cesta.stanford.edu) (CESTA), a humanities and social sciences Digital Humanities Laboratory,  and [Historypin](www.historypin.org), a online space where millions of people can come together, from across different generations, cultures and places, to share small glimpses of the past and to build up the huge story of human history through the geolocation of images and stories.. Our project seeks to test ways in which humanities researchers might use different types of crowdsourcing and communitysourcing to further research, and ask questions that would be difficult or impossible to do in more traditional modes of inquiry.   Because of the possibilities of wider engagement, crowdsourcing offers opportunities to advance humanistic work with and beyond the walls of the academy. We seek to identify and explore the best practices as well as pitfalls of a few crowdsourcing methods. To do so, we are conducting three simultaneous crowdsourcing projects: The Year of the Bay, Living with the Railroads, and 500 Novels.  Each project is engaged with different kinds of crowds, and is asking different questions.  More information regarding these can be found under Projects menu above.  Explore the site, learn about our projects, download useful crowdsourcing tools, and check back for updates and future white papers.
